# React-blockchain-starter

> A React project that uses the power of React with a solidity contract and web3. All we are doing is creating a single interactive component to execute a contract on the ethereum network.

## Build Setup

##### There are instructions to build this app for production, but keep in mind that we wont be pushing this component to production during our walkthrough.

``` bash
# instructions coming soon! 

```

INSTRUCTIONS.md coming soon (like the walkthrough for Vue on the blockchain)
